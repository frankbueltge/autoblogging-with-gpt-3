# autoblogging-with-gpt-3

The code:

1. Fetches a RSS feed and parses the XML
2. Extracts the title of the first item in the RSS feed
3. Uses the title as an input for an OpenAI API request
4. Writes the response from the OpenAI API to an XML file

You can use the data from the XML file which includes the response from openai to create a new Wordpress post automatically 
with several tools or plugins available for Wordpress to create posts from XML files or RSS feeds.

Basically, it's the ultimate autoblogging tool not only for WordPress. It automates everything!
