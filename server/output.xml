The world of art and technology have been intertwined for centuries, but the recent emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened up a whole new realm of possibilities. Y Combinator-backed Poly is a startup that is leveraging AI to create art assets for game developers, filmmakers, and other creatives.

Poly uses AI to generate art assets that are both visually stunning and highly customizable. The company’s technology can generate 3D models, textures, animations, and more with just a few clicks. This makes it easier for developers to quickly create high-quality content without having to spend time manually creating each asset from scratch.

The company’s AI-powered platform also allows users to customize their assets in real-time. This means that developers can tweak the look and feel of their creations without having to start from scratch each time they make a change. This makes it easier for developers to iterate on their designs and create unique content that stands out from the crowd.

In addition to providing art assets, Poly also offers tools for creating interactive experiences such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). These tools allow developers to create immersive experiences that can be enjoyed by users on any device or platform.

Y Combinator’s investment in Poly is an exciting development in the world of AI-powered art creation. With its powerful tools and customizable features, Poly is making it easier than ever before for developers to create stunning visuals with minimal effort. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more amazing creations from this innovative startup in the future.
